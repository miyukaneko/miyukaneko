	<p>I always wanted to bake</p>
	<p>And now I have a job so I'm done robbing</p>
	<p style="color:tomato;">Thank you boss!</p>
	<p><i>from that day on, yellow bird became a great coworker and friend.</i><p>
	<p><i>even after your death, he inherited the business and your bakery became a world-known company.</i></p>
	<p><i>Even as a billion dollar company, yellow bird donates and gives away fresh bread everyday to the poor.</i></p>
	<p><i>Yellow bird stays humble and kind, because he never forgets what you taught him</i></p>
	<p><i>he will forever thank you for the second chance you gave him.</i></p>
