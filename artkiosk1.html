            <h2 class="h5">INFO:</h3>
            <p> During 2022 - 2023, I had the wonderful opportunity to work with Fung Collaboratives and the Redwood City Improvement Association to create my first solo exhibition at the Art Kiosk on courthouse square at 2208 Broadway, Redwood City. The Art Kiosk is a public gallery space located in the heart of the historical redwood city, in which artists from all over the world create site-commissioned works on display for a month. The initiative was conceived and is curated by Lance M. Fung. Donated curatorial work and project management for the exhibition series is provided by Fung Collaboratives. The Redwood City Improvement Association (RCIA) has been the sole sponsor ever since the inaugural year of 2019. </p>
            <p>As a freshly graduated baby artist, this project was huge for me - with thoughts of fear, pressure, excitement and hope, I thought to myself, what is the most “miyu” project I can make? My answer to this was a fun, cutesy work with a message geared towards younger generations. A digital, mixed-media work that highlights my hopes and fears, and feelings towards myself and the new generation.</p>

            <h2 class="h5">ARTIST STATEMENT:</h3>
            <p>For my generation, life without internet and social media is unimaginable. Technology often shapes and defines our relationships, values, and time. This inevitably gives birth to two identities, one online and another offline. How can we differentiate the two in a healthy way?</p>
            <p>“Looking through the blue-lit window” focuses on the addictive nature and glorification of social media, and its effects on our online and offline identities. “Looking through rose-tinted glasses” is a common phrase used by earlier generations in observance of seeing only the pleasant things. The gen Z’s glasses come in the form of LED screens. Studies show gen Z spends around 9 hours on average, half of our waking hours on screen time. Physically, the screen distorts our perception of time, since the blue light emits shorter wavelengths and higher energy than other colors. This combination disrupts our body's natural wake and sleep cycle. Mentally, it distorts our values and priorities, resulting in unhealthy relationships and lifestyles. Our self-worth diminishes as it becomes all too easy to compare our lives to the more vibrant lives the window shows us.</p>
            <p>“Looking through the blue-lit window” uses 6 layers of plexiglass sheets to create a sense of depth. Each panel illustrates a window in tandem with the others and results in a tunnel effect. These layers give an overdose of colorful visuals. Upon seeing the artwork as a whole, it aims to be alluring while oppressive, signifying what lies behind the façade.</p>
            <p>This installation is my answer to the question: “How can we build a healthier relationship with technology, as our cyborg identities become more and more inevitable?” I hope to present the realization between the distinction of the online and offline identity and invite all to take a step back from the tunnel to see the bigger picture. The internet is not inherently a dangerous, negative space, nor is it completely positive and safe. It is up to us as individuals to navigate through the tunnel of windows and find our identity within.</p>
